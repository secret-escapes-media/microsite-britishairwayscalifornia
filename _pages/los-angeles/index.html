  <p class="lead-paragraph">A city as bustling with myth, legend and spirit as this, offers a curious experience to any visitor. Hollywood glamour sits aside liberal, laissez faire creativity, where taco trucks offer a feast to rival any Michelin dining experience, and tiny indie venues pack as much a punch as stalwart, glitzy locales. A tapestry of dynamic neighbourhoods offer a diverse range of mini-destinations, a sprawling landscape that can seem overwhelming – yet one that is easily navigable by an affordable metro system. It is all encapsulated in this one Cali star.</p>

  <p class="lead-paragraph">My name is BreeLayne and I'm the founder and creative director of my sustainable luxury womenswear brand, based in Los Angeles.</p>
  <p>Because I grew up in Malibu, it was inevitable for me to have my line be solely made in LA. My childhood home was in a canyon so, I was always really influenced by nature.  When I decided to start my line, it was a natural progression for me to have a brand that focuses heavily on sustainability and conscientious impact. LA has a lot of little neighbourhoods and is a spread out city so there is so much to draw from, as it is really the epicenter of everything. </p>
expert-specialty: >
  <p>The arts community here has grown over the years and I really love working with people in LA because it's so much more mellow and less cut-throat than New York.</p>
  <p>What is really amazing about being based in LA is that we're really on the forefront of sustainability and there is such an emphasis on how we can not only help our community, but the environment. There's also a little bit of everything here, so if you look hard enough, you're bound to find what you're looking for! My studio is downtown and it has really flourished within this past year, every day there are new restaurants and galleries popping up. I love that you can find so many hidden gems on every corner. </p>
