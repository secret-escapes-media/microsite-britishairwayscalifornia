  <p class="lead-paragraph">My name is Carolyn and I am the owner and operator of The Barrel Room, a cozy little wine bar and shop in Rockridge, Oakland.
  <p>My love of wine stems from its ability to bring people together and to create enduring memories. Whether it’s crafting unforgettable wine and food pairings or sharing the connections of wine with history, food and language with my guests. I thrive on finding new avenues to explore when tasting and discovering new wines from around the world.</p>

  <p>The vibrant wine and food scene in Oakland has fostered much of my continued self education and love of wine. Oakland boasts a plethora of wineries, not to mention importers based right here, who bring in wines from all over the world including lesser-known wine producing countries such as Georgia and Slovenia. </p>
  <p>There are constantly locally crafted wine shops and bars popping up in Oakland, in addition to (of course) fabulous new restaurants with well curated wine lists. I feel a sense of community here that is unique to Oakland, where folks in the wine industry encourage and support one another. </p>
