    ########## San Francisco ###########

  - type: city
    title: San Francisco
    class: san-francisco
    position: "top: 53%; left: 39%;"
    description: >
      Fact and fiction collide in the enigmatic hub of free love, beatnik slumber, pride and resplendent Victorians perched precariously on steep, winding streets. San Francisco is the mother of counter-culture, and is a bucket-list American destination that never fails to offer something new.

  - type:
    title: San Jose
    class: san-jose
    distance: Less than 1 hour drive from San Francisco
    position: "top: 56%; left: 43%;"

    distance: 1 hour drive from San Francisco
    position: "top: 55%; left: 42%;"
    description: >

    title: Santa Cruz Surfing Museum
    class: santa-cruz-surfing-museum
    distance: 1 hour drive from San Francisco
    position: "top: 59%; left: 41.5%;"
    description: >
      Santa Cruz is the mainland home of surfing; it was here that in 1885, that three Hawaiian princes rode the waves in the San Lorenzo river and kickstarted a fashion that is still popular today. It makes sense then, to explore Surf City’s boarding history at this quirky museum.

  - type:
    title: Cannery Row
    class: cannery-row
    distance: 2 hour drive from San Francisco
    position: "top: 62.5%; left: 43.5%;"

  - type: large
    title: Lake Tahoe
    class: lake-tahoe
    distance: 3.5 hour drive from San Francisco
    position: "top: 42%; left: 59%;"
    description: >

  - type: large
    title: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park
    class: sequoia-park
    distance: 4 hour drive from San Francisco
    position: "top: 65%; left: 79%;"
    description: >
      A hoard of magnificent trees epitomise this state treasure, with towering Sequoias that defy belief in their scale and grandeur. This is an ancient space; most of the trees are more than 2,000 years old, and the scene only changes with vast, piercing mountains. A treasure, for sure.

  - type: large
    title: Death Valley
    class: death-valley
    distance: 4 hour drive from Los Angeles
    position: "top: 55%; left: 77%;"
    description: >
      A rather ominous name for what can only be described as a striking place of extremes. It has set records for hottest place in the US, lowest place in the US, and second largest National Park. An eerie yet iconic landscape which, as the name suggests, should be explored with caution.

  - type:
    title: Hearst Castle
    class: hearst-castle
    distance: 4 hour drive from Los Angeles
    position: "top: 74%; left: 52.5%;"
    description: >
      Designed by California’s first female architect as a private resident for publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, this 165 room castle has incredible wraparound views of the Central Coast. Its neo-classical-cum-medieval-revival architecture is certainly unexpected, and a glorious oddity to explore.



    ########## Los Angeles ###########

  - type: city
    title: Los Angeles
    class: los-angeles
    position: "top: 89%; left: 74%;"
    description: >
      A city as bustling with myth, legend and spirit as this, offers a curious experience to any visitor. Hollywood glamour sits aside liberal, laissez faire creativity, where taco trucks offer a feast to rival any michelin dining experience, and tiny indie venues pack as much a punch as stalwart, glitzy locales. A tapestry of dynamic neighbourhoods offer a diverse range of mini-destinations, all within this one Cali star.

  - type:
    title: Huntington Beach and Surf Music
    class: huntington-beach-and-surf-music
    distance: 1 hour drive from Los Angeles
    position: "top: 89.5%; left: 76%;"
    description: >
      The surf capital south of LA has been a bonafide surfing institution for generations. From palms to white sands, it’s easy to see how the early sixties beach scene took off. Further down the coast at Newport is the spot of the Rendezvous Ballroom, where artists like Dick Dale and The Challengers created the swamped reverb sounds of surf music.

  - type:
    title: Channel Islands National Park
    class: channel-islands-national-park
    distance: 1 hour drive from Los Angeles
    position: "top: 86.5%; left: 70%;"
    description: >
      Five islands off the Southern California coast comprise one of America’s most remote – and utterly magical – national parks. Visitors arrive on the islands by boat (boats depart regularly from Ventura and Oxnard) or small plane, then use their hiking boots or kayaks to get around.

  - type:
    title: Coronado Shores Shipwreck
    class: coronado-shores-shipwreck
    distance: 2 hour drive from Los Angeles
    position: "top: 99.5%; left: 86%;"
    description: >
      This often submerged shipwreck reveals, at low tide, a Californian past of illegality and frivolity. The ship was converted into a casino to exercise a legal loophole which made it legal if moored three miles from shore. After a bad storm, it ran aground – though no-one could now claim the illegal ship.

  - type:
    title: Salvation Mountain
    class: salvation-mountain
    distance: 2.5 hour drive from Los Angeles
    position: "top: 95%; left: 100%;"
    description: >
      This famous desert-bound piece of folk art has won the hearts of visitors for years. Colourfully painted with religious messaging and imagery, it’s an artistic oddity that has quickly become an iconic and treasured Californian artwork.

  - type:
    title: Children's Pool, La Jolla
    class: children-s-pool
    distance: Less than 1 hour drive from San Diego
    position: "top: 94.5%; left: 84%;"
    description: >
      Initially conceived as a safe place for children to swim in the sea, it has evolved into a favourite haunt of the local seal population. A charming sight, Children’s Pool has been claimed by our seal friends – offering respite, at times, to hundreds of the slippery sea pups.

  - type:
    title: Drive-in Theatres
    class: drive-in-theatres
    distance: Less than 1 hour drive from San Diego
    position: "top: 95.5%; left: 89%;"
    description: >
      At South Bay or Santee, a now forgotten slice of Americana exists, an ever popular and iconic activity that has become rather scarce; not here though. From teenage dates in muscle cars, or a cheap family night out, this is one of those all-American bucket list tickets.

  - type: large
    title: Anza Borrego Desert State Park
    class: anza-borrego-desert-state-park
    distance: 2 hour drive from San Diego
    position: "top: 93%; left: 93%;"
    description: >
      Voted the best state park in California, this desert community is the perfect spot for stargazing, having become the state’s first Dark Sky Community. The quirky hotels and peaceful surroundings make this an incredible overnight retreat.



    ########## San Diego ###########

  - type: city
    title: San Diego
    class: san-diego
    position: "top: 98%; left: 85.5%;"
    description: Year round sunshine, charming bistros and cafés, long beaches and great surfing – and not to mention the craft beer home of the US – San Diego is a hip US destination known as Cali’s beach escape, with a buzzing city to match.
