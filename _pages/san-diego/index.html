  <p class="lead-paragraph">Year round sunshine, charming bistros and cafés, long beaches and great surfing – and not to mention the craft beer capital of America, with 125 breweries making it the ‘Capital of Craft’ – San Diego is a hip US destination known as Cali’s beach escape, with a buzzing city to match. </p>

  <p class="lead-paragraph">Cosimo Sorrentino is the name and brewing is my game.</p>
  <p>I grew up in the South Park neighborhood of San Diego, right next to Downtown. After working in restaurants and specializing in wine I discovered the affordability and abundance of beer here in America’s finest city. It was a quick transition to home brewing and after a couple years of having local brewers and publicans provide feedback, I was offered the lead position at Monkey Paw. Two years ago we opened a second brew pub, South Park Brewing on my original stomping grounds. The opportunity to participate in and grow with the beer industry while serving people in the community where I was raised has been an amazing experience.</p>
expert-specialty: >
  <p>San Diego is the best beer city in the world. With over 130 breweries in the county, the quality and pace of innovation is unrivaled. There is a wide range of breweries spanning from the 100 gallon system at Border X to the Ballast Point production facility where 7,500 gallons goes through the brew house six to eight times a day. With this abundance and community support, locally produced beer has integrated itself into our biggest venues and is present at nearly every event. Drop into O’Briens, Toronado or Hamiltons to find a variety of taps and bottles that will please any palate or ask for a local, independent beer wherever you go.</p>
