  <p class="lead-paragraph">San Francisco is, in many ways, the mother of societal and cultural flourish on the West Coast. It harboured the literary masterstrokes of the beat generation, through a network cafes, bars and book shops, and fostered counterculture at Haight-Ashbury. The Summer of Love remains the most expressive and pivotal symbols of San Francisco’s creativity and cultural importance, and its 50th anniversary this year will see the city explode in a sea of colour and eclectic nostalgia. For all of this year’s nostalgic celebration, you’ll still find a city leading the way with music, art and culture, and  a foodie scene defined by the Bay Area’s unique produce.</p>

  <p class="lead-paragraph">My name is Kelly Ording and I am an artist that creates works on paper and canvas, large scale murals and public artworks. </p>
  <p>I came to San Francisco about twenty years ago to attend the San Francisco Art Institute and I’ve been in love with the city ever since. San Francisco has a rich history of attracting creative thinkers, from the Beat poets of the 1950s to the psychedelic rock’n’roll bands of the 1960s.  To this day, there is an energetic and supportive arts community that is open to people seeking a creative lifestyle. I think San Francisco is small enough that an artist can really make a home for oneself and build a community pretty quickly.</p>
expert-specialty: >
  <p>San Francisco has been changing in many ways due to the “tech boom” in recent years and the arts community has really been transforming due to these changes. However, there are a lot of creative and exciting things happening. There are new gallery spaces opening up; such as Minnesota Street Project and new museums being built such as the Mexican Museum Downtown. Also, there is a huge love of murals in San Francisco and you really do see them everywhere in the city which makes it a great place to visit if you love street and public art.</p>

        description: >
          This avant-garde bar was the backdrop for the beatnik cool of the beat generation, having served Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Neal Cassady. Dylan Thomas and Bob Dylan were also visitors, so head down and bask in the cultural magnetism of this boho bar.

      - title: Caffe Trieste
        class: caffe-trieste
        description: >
          Said to be the first espresso house on the West Coast, Caffe Trieste is a firm Italian favourite of beatniks and hip locals. It became a veritable hangout of the beat generation, with Kerouac, Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti (still a regular!) and many more often found pensively sipping espresso and ruminating on post-WWII culture.

      - title: Lolo
        class: lolo
        experts-pick: true

      <p class="lead-paragraph">Culture permeates the history of San Francisco – from brooding beatnik poetry, hippy revolution, LGBT activism and an identity forged by liberalism and openness.  </p>

    places:
      - title: City Lights Bookstore
        featured: true
        class: city-lights-bookstore
        description: >
          This bookstore is a beacon not only for the beat movement, but also for the wider social revolution of mid-century America. It was here where Allen Ginsberg’s Howl was published and sold, causing the arrest of the owner and salesperson – who were released, and sparked a shift in artistic and social freedoms.

      - title: Haight-Ashbury
        class: haight-ashbury
        description: >
          The epicentre of the ‘67 Summer of Love. This was the stomping ground of free-thinking youthful exuberance, charged by a backdrop of war and civil unrest. As America’s youth gathered, creativity flourished whilst civil oppression was challenged, and changed forever. Take a tour, and discover the importance of this pocket neighbourhood.

      - title: Castro Theatre
        class: castro-theatre
        description: >
          This movie-palace is a stalwart entertainment centre, which quickly became a gay icon. Catch cult movies preluded by live grand Wurlitzer (a must!), or plenty of sing-a-long musical film nights (participation obligatory!).

        class: sfmoma
        description: >
          <p>San Francisco’s premier modern art institution is set in an iconic contemporary building that sets the tone for your visit. Catch Matisse, Pollock, Duchamp and Warhol plus many more, in this illustrious space.</p>

      - title: Rincon Annex
        class: rincon-annex
        secret: true
        description: >
          This unassuming post office contains a cultural treasure ripe for discovery – within, the walls are decked with murals by Russian-born artist Anton Refregier, dubbed ‘History of California’. It’s a fascinating glimpse that is made all the more intrepid by its designation as Communist and threatening under McCarthyism, which nearly saw the work be destroyed.



  - title: Attractions
    class: attractions
    content: >
      <p class="lead-paragraph">San Francisco’s colourful history has gifted upon its population a joie de vivre that plays joyously throughout its attractions and often unconventional quirks.</p>

    places:
      - title: Musée Mécanique
        featured: true
        class: musée-mécanique
        description: >
          On Pier 45 is this free marvel of vintage penny slot fun, packed with age-old pieces for you to sink your pennies, dimes and quarters into. Dedicated to penny arcade machines from the turn of the century and beyond, Musée Mécanique is a hands-on ride through vintage charms and antique quirks.

      - title: Golden Gate Bridge
        class: golden-gate-bridge
        description: >
          This most famous of San Francisco’s landmarks spans, as the name suggests, the Golden Gate. A perfect photo opportunity for your Instagram and the like. Golden Gate Park is a great spot to oggle this wonder, and also hosts the excellent California Academy of Sciences.

      - title: Cable Car
        class: cable-car
        description: >
          Hop on the famous cable car, the only manually operated cable car in the world! This San Francisco institution will make your head spin as it climbs the steep slopes and sees you hanging on the sides – an iconic ride through the city.

      - title: Alcatraz
        class: alcatraz
        description: >
          This foreboding island fortress is a morbid icon in the bay of San Francisco. Seemingly impossible to escape, a tour provides a dark and anxious history of this rather terrifying place.

      - title: Lombard Street
        class: lombard-street
        description: >
          The famous eight-hairpin turn road is a bonafide San Francisco icon. Aside from actually being a  rather beautiful example of urban planning, with its gardened rising sections, its unique make-up is eminently practical; its design follows the belief that the hill it sits on would be too steep for vehicles at the time of its inception.

      - title: Clarion Alley
        class: clarion-alley
        experts-pick: true
        description: >
          One of my favorite places in the city is Clarion Alley, where the entire block is painted with murals. Since its inception in 1992, this block has been home to over 700 murals at one time or another and really is the heart and soul of street art in San Francisco.

          This morbidly fascinating shop is packed with gothic charms. Think taxidermy displayed in anthropomorphic dioramas, Victorian oddities and post-hippy kitsch – a must visit for offbeat trinkets.

      - title: Schein & Schein
        class: schein-schein
        description: >
          This hole-in-the-wall curiosity specialises in maps and rare books – with a certain penchant for the local. Walk away with a turn-of-the-century map of San Francisco, a perfect souvenir to take home.
